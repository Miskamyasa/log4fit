Welcome to Log4Fit, the React Native app designed to revolutionize your gym sessions. With an intuitive and self-learning interface, my app is here to help you track your progress, stay motivated, and push your limits like never before.

## Core Functionality

At its core, Log4Fit focuses on minimal functionality, allowing you to easily log your workouts without any unnecessary complexities. But that’s just the beginning - I have big plans to expand the app’s capabilities based on your feedback and requirements.

## Visualize Your Fitness Journey

One exciting future feature is the ability to transform your workout history into meaningful progress graphs. Imagine being able to visualize your fitness journey, identifying trends, and celebrating your achievements. With this added functionality, you’ll have a clear understanding of how far you’ve come and what goals to set next.

## Convenient Timer Feature

Additionally, I know that rest periods between sets are crucial in determining the effectiveness of your workout. That’s why I'm also working on integrating a convenient timer feature that will make it easy for you to time your breaks. No more guesswork, just perfect timing for optimized performance.

## Designed for Gym Enthusiasts

My target audience is specific, catering to those who understand the challenges of pushing your limits in the gym. Whether you’re struggling to complete a workout or looking to push yourself further, Log4Fit is here to support you. Unlike other apps, I don’t limit you to pre-defined exercise lists. Instead, you have the freedom to add exercises on the go. If you successfully complete a set, record it. If not, simply move on. My app seamlessly adapts to your workout style, making it ideal for split approaches like biceps and triceps, where you can switch between exercises effortlessly with a quick swipe.

## Easy Set Recording

With Log4Fit, recording your sets is a breeze, requiring just two simple clicks. I believe in keeping things minimal, allowing you to focus on what matters most - your workout.
